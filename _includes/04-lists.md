  ### Ordered Lists

  Ordered lists have numbers and can have indented children that are also ordered.

  When you're creating ordered lists, you can type out the exact number you want to show in order, (1, 2, 3, etc.) but you can also type every number as "1.". Markdown will take care of the rest of the numbering for you, and your list will be easier to maintain.

  ```
  1. Item 1
  1. Item 2
  1. Item 3
     1. Item 3a
     1. Item 3b
  ```

  1. Item 1
  1. Item 2
  1. Item 3
     1. Item 3a
     1. Item 3b
